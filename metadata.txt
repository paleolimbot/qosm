email=dewey@fishandwhistle.net

about=Download and use Open Street Map <http://www.openstreetmap.org/> and other tiled basemap sources. Similar to the OpenLayers plugin and TMS layers, except QOSM has smarter cacheing, works better in non-cylindrical projections, and offers options to cache tiles and manipulate zoom levels.
